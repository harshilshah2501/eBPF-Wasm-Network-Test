# eBPF-Wasm-Network-Test
 This project combines WebAssembly (Wasm), eBPF, and Docker to create a system for monitoring network activities such as ping, traceroute, and iperf. The WebAssembly module handles the userâ€™s network test requests, while eBPF traces the relevant system calls to gather metrics, such as average round-trip time (RTT), packet loss, and bandwidth. Docker provides a containerized environment for running the project.
